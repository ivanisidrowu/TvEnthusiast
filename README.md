## Attention
!!! This APP only contains TV shows information, and it does not provide pirate videos. !!!

## Data source
This APP uses TMDB API, an open soure data API, for getting TV shows information.

https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api

## How to build it

### Get an TMDB API KEY
Get a developer api key via...
https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api

### Configure your API key
Add API key in gradle.build
```
buildConfigField STRING, "API_KEY", "\"${YOUR_APIKEY}\""
```

### Configure retrolamda
Change jdk location in build.gradle under "app" directory.
```
retrolambda {
        jdk '${JAVA8_HOME_PATH}'
        oldJdk '${JAVA7_HOME_PATH}'
        javaVersion JavaVersion.VERSION_1_7
        jvmArgs '-noverify'
        defaultMethods false
        incremental true
}
```

## Implementation

### MVP
It was implemented in Model-View-Presenter pattern (MVP). Model represents the database model and pojos that could be display on views. View is a interface to display information. Presenter is just like a middle man who communicates with mode and view. For example, user clicked a button on view to ask for more information. View tells presenter to get data from repository or server, then it tells view to display the data. Every model, view, and presenter has interface and implementation, so we can easily manipulate them. Models and pojos have their builders because they have a lot of contructors. Builders helps to new an object gracefully.

### Service
This APP provides a feature that informs user which episode will be airing today. The service was implemented with IntentService and AlarmManager. IntentService takes care of the background works. AlarmManager controls the service to execute daily model updates and show notifications.

### RxJava, Retrofit, Realm, and Retrolambda
RxJava actually helps a lot when you write complicated requests and chained callback. If you use RxJava, it will take care of them. All you have to do just focus on the flow. Luckily, Retrofit and Realm support observable. So that will be easier for us to adopt them. Retrolambda is an plugin that allows you to write lambda. I think the code will be more concise and readable if you use lambda especially you are using RxJava.

## Notes
I'm still modifying the tests. I will commit them as soon as possible.
